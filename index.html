  <h1>Malik is Innocent</h1>
  <img src="malik.png">
  <p>Meet Malik Gary, Armstrong High School Graduate. He is thoughtful,
      intelligent, soft-spoken, a leader among his friends, and an all-around
      wonderful young man. While visiting family in Richmond in July 2020,
      he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was arrested for a
      serious crime of which I know he is innocent. This website is dedicated to
      sharing his story.</p>
